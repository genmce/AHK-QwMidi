Welcome to QwMidi2k v0.05 December 2010

To start just unzip the contents to a folder of your choice and run the program (or AHK file if you have autohotkey installed).
You can run the program from the supplied links which set the generic keyboard type in the ini file. I'm now using scancodes
so this may also suite other keyboard types such as QWERTZ but I don't know for sure.

The program is simular to QwMidi - lets you play a midi instrument or mulitple midi instruments from the computer keyboard. 
* There is an upper and lower keyboard to output notes to different midi ports, or to the general midi synth. There is also a basic percussion facility and metronome

The help file is a jpg that may be viewed with the program or with almost any picture editor.

Escape = toggle on/off, changes icon

Ability to send multiple notes (coroutines)
Noteon is sent on keydown and noteoff on keyup
Change settings via tray icon
Store everything in an ini file

This program is free and offered without warranty under the GNU GPL 2.0. 

AHK source file included.

If you use code from QwMidi an acknowledge would be appreciated (JimVF@Autohotkey) - this would not entail any charge but
equally I cannot guaranty support.

As provided by me, QwMidi does not write to registry, access the internet or anything outside the directory you install it into.
